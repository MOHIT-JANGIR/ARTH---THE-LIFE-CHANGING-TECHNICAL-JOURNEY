Hey guys,

Just wanted to share something with you guys and I probably don‚Äôt know how to give proper shape to my words but in one word ‚ÄúThankyou‚Äú. To whom you may ask, it‚Äôs too my mentor and teacher Mr. Vimal Daga. I still remember, at the start of Arth, sir asked us to make a video telling about what we know, the skills we have and that task was just a beginning of our technical journey...

I learnt that only learning programming languages will not help in any way because it is something like this i am focussing on a glass of water out of whole ocean ,till the we don't know how to integrate all the technologies to solve a real industry problems because one technology is just a single part of that project/use-case and for less time and space complexity and for achieving end-to-end automation ,it is required to integrate all the required parts/technologies...

I learnt that only learning coding won't help till the time we are exposed to some life lessions like keep sharing our knowledge, take own and others responsibility and many more.

I started my journey with ARTH on 12th Sep, 2020. WHEN I WAS YOUNG I USED TO THINK THAT, IF ONE TEACHER CAN‚ÄôT TEACH US ALL SUBJECTS THEN HOW ONE STUDENT CAN LEARN ALL SUBJECTS?

But when i started my journey with ARTH then i got my answer. Because vimal sir give me right education. and vimal sir told me that all technology is created by human so we can learn every technology. 

I not only gained lots of technical knowledge but I am able to build my self confidence that yes, I can do something different.. and also I tried and trying to overcome my fears like I had fear to write blogs and posts. But now by doing tasks and other stuff, I am creating my own blogs and this is my first blog in which I am expressing my love towards whole LinuxWorld Informatics Pvt Ltd family...

Today, on successful completion of knowledgeable sessions delivered in each lecture of ARTH - The School of Technologies by Vimal Sir. I have reached to a phase of life where I feel the videos which were been watched by me of Vimal sir telling and guiding about the technology, learning values are imbibe in my personality too, Today I feel more confident, strongly cleared with of correct knowledge to portrait and speak up on any of my learnt technology with perspective of a Right learner.

I am very blessed to have such a great mentor like Vimal Daga sir. The way he teaches and motivates us is far different from others and that makes him unique in his own way‚Ä¶.

In the ARTH program, Vimal sir gave lots of tasks to us and I am able to solve those tasks this gives me more happiness and my confidence also starts building.

The IIEC Community Organised a great workshop ‚ÄúBuild Artificial Intelligence Enabled Machine to help fight against any pandemic or any disaster‚Äù. That workshop is mentored by Mr. Vimal Daga Sir and I learned many things about Machine Learning and How we can test with X-rays to confirm a person is tested positive or negative to covid 19. Great Announcement about the training of MLOps by Vima Daga Sir in the workshop.

April

Joined MLOps training by Linux World Informatics India under the mentorship of Mr. Vimal Daga, Sir started the training with the moto that One can learn anything in less time with the Right Approach. Sir proved and completed major concepts of Machine Learning. Started with DevOps tools. Learned Git, GitHub, and Jenkins. Integrated Machine Learning with DevOps tools to automatically create an ML Model by Jenkins triggers and Automatic HyperParametes tunning in ML Model. I learned the consistency to learn. I started to learn a new thing every day. I searched in google about DevOps Tools. There are a lot of tools. Joined DevOps Assembly Lines training parallel with MLOps training.


May
Started to learn DevOps Assembly Lines with an aim to know how the companies deliver their software quickly with the DevOps approach. I know Git, GitHub, and Jenkins from MLOps and want to learn some tools. I learned Kubernetes, Maven, and Metrics Monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana. I enjoyed when learning monitoring tools and Grafana supports great visuals and they are good to see. Kubernetes is to orchestrate or to manage containers in a huge infrastructure. Solving the challenging tasks given in training is super awesome

June
After metrics Monitoring tools, I learned Log Monitoring tools, ELK Stack - Elastic Search, Logstash, and the Kibana. Created Data Pipeline with ELK Stack. I didn‚Äôt feel any difficulty understanding these tools. There is a myth about advanced concepts and tools as harder learn. but Sir proved that is wrong. When teaching these advanced tools. I didn't felt any difficulties understanding. Integrated all the tools I learned in DevOps Assembly Lines and create a pipeline of all of these tools and automated everything from developer to production and automated testing with unit testing.
Learned to do Self Reflection and It will help one to grow day by day. We at Linux World Used to do Self Reflection every day and share what we learn on social media platforms like LinkedIn and that helped to connect with people who are working professionals.

July
It‚Äôs time to power the infrastructure and the tools I learned with cloud computing. Joined Hybrid Multi-Cloud Computing by Linux World . Learned Amazon Web Services. Learned to provision the AWS resources with Terraform. Learned the private cloud platform OpenStack. As Technical Guys, we can‚Äôt solve custom use cases with any Public cloud ad They abstract the things how cloud actually works. Vimal Daga Sir proved every statement he spoke when he taught the AWS with OpenStack cloud. Learned OpenStack to that level I can solve some special use cases. Learned to provision resources on OpenStack cloud with Terraform. Learned Kubernetes which is the Platform As A Service and provisioned resources with Terraform. Leaned Elastic Kubernetes As A Service which is the managed Kubernetes as a service from AWS in a Workshop by Linux World
Created Hybrid setup of Platform As A Service and Infrastructure As A Service with Kubernetes on top of Multiple Cloud Platform [ Public Cloud and Private Cloud ]

August
The Month of Frontend and Startup, I learned The Flutter, Building Native Applications with a single code base of Dart. Integrated Flutter with Docker. Integrated Flutter with Google FireBase and learned to create a Chat Application. Learned to create a Terminal Application to run Linux commands with the help of API. Created API to use with Flutter Application to run commands. Learned Automation tool Ansible the powerful tool in DevOps Field. Configured multiple Infrastructures to setup Kubernetes Cluster with Ansible. Attended Great Workshop on Google Cloud Platform by Linux World and Learned major services of GCP. Learned more than what we used to learn from a normal Workshop.
Learned how to do Market Research about an Idea and learned how to present a startup Idea effectively from Preeti Chandak Ma‚Äôam. Worked on a startup Idea and had multiple Brain Storming Sessions about the Idea and It was a really great Experience listening to all the ideas from my friends who are learning Flutter with me. This is the major step to learn to think like a creator and validate the Idea we have with us.

September
Joined the Specialist in Python training from Indian Innovation and Entrepreneurship community. Learned to create an API with CGI. Learned about NumPy and Pandas in detail.
Heard the Great Talk from Mr. Vimal Daga Sir about ARTH - The School of Technologies. The most awaited Announcement about ARTH.

ARTH ‚Äî The School of Technologies is an 8 to 10 months technical learning program.

On September 14, The Life-Changing Technical Journey Started. I learn Hadoop to solve the BigData Challenge. Learned Internals about Hadoop and capture network packets with tcpdump to prove the theory about Hadoop. Started with the AWS CSA track. I was grown from taking help to help someone. I selected as a Technical Volunteer to help my friends

October
Implemented some Data Structures and Algorithms on Hadoop. I know Data Structures Previous but I did a dedicative course but don‚Äôt know where to use implement the Data Structures to solve some use cases. DSA is an approach to solve a particular problem. Learned multiple things like Hadoop, DSA, and Docker in Parallel. I learned a different approach to learning the DSA with Python Notebook Magic Functions
The month of OpenSourc ‚Äî Hactoberfest üòç. Participated in multiple Opensource Events and Learn to contribute to OpenSource. I just didn‚Äôt make any PR but I learned to do PR.

November
Continue to learn Hadoop, DSA, Docker, Machine Learning, Ansible, and AWS CSA on Weekends. Learned to implement some DSA on Hadoop.Configured Hadoop with Ansible
Completed the 30 Days of Google Cloud Platform Challenge and completed Cloud Engineering and Data Science and Machine Learning Tracks. I learned GCP in the Two Days workshop by Linux World, that knowledge is enough to complete these two tracks.

December
Fourth Month of ARTH ‚Äî The School of Technologies. Completed multiple tasks related to Hadoop, DSA, Docker, Machine Learning, and AWSCSA. Started with the Data Analytics part from DataScience. Learned a lot about Networking and how packets route to reach the client from server and vise versa. Learned the advanced concepts of Ansible.

Finally, I am on the Last Day of the year 2020. Writing my story to prove that a college student or fresher can do great with the Right Education and Right Mentor like Vimal Daga Sir

1) Two things highly motivated me to do this Learning seamlessly
2) Share the things you Learn
Take the Responsibility of Other

I learned these Two should have qualities from Mr. Vimal Daga sir and Mrs. Preeti Chandak Ma‚Äôam. I can't do anything just one thing...
Thank you Sir and Ma‚Äôam from my bottom of Heart for Making the Best Version of Me, that I am today.
